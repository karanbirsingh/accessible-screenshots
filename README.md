built by repurposing [accessibility insights](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-windows)

This application allows you to take screenshots with accessibility metadata. When a screenshot is initiated, it captures information from the [UI Automation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview) tree and embeds properties in the resulting PNG file itself. Users can view the embedded information using a photo viewer that understands how to read the accessibility metadata (example [here](https://github.com/karanbirsingh/photo-viewer)).
